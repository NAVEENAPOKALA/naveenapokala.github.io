  <!-- Project 1 -->
  <h3>AI/ML Research Assistant — UNC Greensboro</h3>
  <p><em>February 2025 – Present</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Built end-to-end training and evaluation pipelines for LLM-based models,
      integrating LLaMA-2 embeddings with CNN architectures to process 10,000+
      natural language documents.
    </li>
    <li>
      Engineered a time-series ML framework combining textual signals with
      numerical market data for predictive analytics.
    </li>
    <li>
      Developed scalable Python ML pipelines for data ingestion, preprocessing,
      embedding generation, model training, and evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Designed retrieval systems using vector embeddings and contextual chunking
      to align long-form NLP text with temporal events.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built distributed PyTorch training pipelines optimized for GPU utilization.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved model performance by 32–45% (lower MAPE) compared to ARIMA baselines.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Project 2 -->
  <h3>AI-Powered Academic Assistant (Flagship GenAI Project)</h3>
  <p><em>February 2025</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Developed a multi-agent LLM workflow using LangChain to retrieve, summarize,
      and validate complex academic content.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented a RAG pipeline using FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, and Zephyr-7B
      for context-aware Q&A over thousands of documents.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built and deployed a FastAPI backend supporting parallel inference, caching,
      and latency-optimized retrieval.
    </li>
    <li>
      Applied advanced prompt engineering to improve model accuracy by 35%.
    </li>
    <li>
      Achieved sub-200ms inference latency through profiling and optimization.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Project 3 -->
  <h3>Bird Species Classification</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Built a supervised image classification model to identify bird species
      as part of a graduate-level machine learning course.
    </li>
    <li>
      Implemented CNN-based models and evaluated performance using standard
      classification metrics.
    </li>
  </ul>
